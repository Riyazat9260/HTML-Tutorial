    <h2>HTML Paragraphs</h2>
    <p>A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.</p>
    <p>The HTML &lt;p&gt; element defines a paragraph.</p>
    <p>A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.</p>

    <h3>HTML Display</h3>
    <p>You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.</p>
    <p>Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.</p>
    <p>With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.</p>
    <p>The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:</p>
    <p><b>Example</b></p>
    <pre>
        &lt;P&gt; This paragraph
        contains a lot of lines
        in the source code,
        but the browser 
        ignores it.&lt;/P&gt;
        </pre>
        
        <pre>
        &lt;P&gt;This paragraph
        contains      a lot of spaces
        in the source     code,
        but the    browser 
        ignores it.&lt;/P&gt;
        </pre>
        
        <pre>
        &lt;P&gt;The number of lines in a paragraph depends on the size of the browser window. If you resize the browser window, the number of lines in this paragraph will change.&lt;/P&gt;
        </pre>

        <p><b>Result</b></p>
        <p>This paragraph contains a lot of lines in the source code, but the browser ignores it.</p>
        <p>This paragraph contains a lot of spaces in the source code, but the browser ignores it.</p>
        <p>The number of lines in a paragraph depends on the size of the browser window. If you resize the browser window, the number of lines in this paragraph will change.</p>
